Scripts I wrote for my Master Thesis

Initial paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10880

What I did?
- for every map of the galaxy (in specific wavelength), I chose a quite large area outside of the galaxy, and I've determined the standard deviation.
- I estimated galactial extinction for each wavelength
- I used Calzetti's atenuation law (http://www.bo.astro.it/~micol/Hyperz/old_public_v1/hyperz_manual1/node10.html)

To be continued...
